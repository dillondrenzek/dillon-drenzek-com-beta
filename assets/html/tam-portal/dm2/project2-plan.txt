	DM2 - Project 2 - Scroll Poem
-------------------------------------
	Notes:
		- As the page scrolls down, content is dynamically created
		- The ultimate goal is for a story to be told by the time the
			user gets to the end of the page

	Scroll Mechanism
--------------------------

	- The mechanism for scrolling using jQuery:

		$(document).scroll(function(){});

		* as the page scrolls down, this function is called

	- The distance scrolled is calculated by the result of the function

		parseInt($(document).scrollTop());

	- I will keep track of the distance scrolled and based on that,
		trigger certain events

		* hopefully, I can find some way to have the entire page respond to the scroll
			for example, i don't want to just trigger animate() events, instead I would like 
			to have the animation done at the pace the user scrolls 
				(also be able to be undone by scrolling back up)

				=> I have realized its going to be much harder to scroll to animate
				=> I'm going to switch to a certain scroll distance that triggers .animate() functions

		* I think this will be possible if I create my own "animate" function
			I could pass the function the scrollTop() value and as that happens move objects, fade them in,
				etc.
