Description:
	I think I would like to expand on th elab I started making for Lab 12. It is a humorous
	way to ask for a girls phone number. I want to create something like a form for someone
	trying to make an appointment with somebody. I will have a space for name, phone number,
	email, "appointment time" and then once everything has been submitted, I'll give them a
	confirmation message. It might even be interesting to try and find a way to send a 
	confirmation email. I don't know if that is probable or not.
	
	I think it would also be great to have the form auto-complete, auto-format, and auto-
	everything as much as possible. Meaning, the cursor will go from field to field by
	itself. For instance, in the phone number field, when she finishes filling out the area
	code, the cursor will automatically go to the next section of the phone number.
	
	There will also be confirmation messages as she fills out the form. Like checkmarks, lots
	and lots of green.
	
	After the form has been submitted, all the data will be put into a database for me. Kind
	of like an address book.
	
	Maybe it would be funny to have a fake Terms and Conditions checkbox at the bottom.
	
Pseudocode:
	I think I will need to use some JavaScript in addition to the php. For instance, the phone 
	number section, I looked online and the way you move the focus from one field to another
	is by using Javascript.
	
	The basic form looks like:
		<form action="" method="post" id="form">
			<label for="name">Name:</label><br>
			<input id="name" type="text" name="name" required autofocus><br><br>
			
			<label for="number">Number:</label><br>
			<input id="number" type="text" name="areacode" tabindex="1" size="3" maxlength="3" onkeyup="checkLen(this,this.value)">
			<input id="number" type="text" name="firstthree" tabindex="2" size="3" maxlength="3" onkeyup="checkLen(this,this.value)">
			<input id="number" type="text" name="lastfour" tabindex="3" size="4" maxlength="4" onkeyup="checkLen(this,this.value)"><br><br>
			
			<label for="datepicker">Date:</label><br>
			<input id="datepicker" type="text" name="datepicker" placeholder="Tomorrow?"><br><br>
			
			<input id="submit" type="submit" name="submit" value="Call Me :)">
		</form>
		
	There will be a datepicker for the date field which is handled by the jQuery UI library:
		<script src="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.js"></script>
		<script>
			$(function() {
			    $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
			  });
		</script>
		
	The telephone field is handled by a function called checkLen() which I have found online, 
	I may try to implement my own version of this function
		<script>
			function checkLen(x,y)
			{
			if (y.length==x.maxLength)
			  {
			  var next=x.tabIndex;
			  if (next<document.getElementById("form").length)
			    {
			    document.getElementById("form").elements[next].focus();
			    }
			  }
			}
		</script>
		

Visual Design:
	
	The visual design will be pretty easy. It should be a simple, attractive looking web form.
	I would like to make this as unserious as possible. I want to experiment with form CSS. 
	I have seen many different textboxes around the web, I think it would be awesome to get
	creative and customize all the form elements.

Testing:
	Obviously, I will test my page on real females! Just kidding. I think the testing process
	will be really easy. I don't really know what to put here. I will simply trial and error 
	the whole thing. Upload to the server, test functionality, rinse, repeat.
