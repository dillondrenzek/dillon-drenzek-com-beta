					<p> Wow, what a busy couple of weeks back to school! I've got two new websites I'm working on as class projects that will be receiving updates often, definitely give them a look! 
						<a href="http://redwood.colorado.edu/didr8696/dm2/" class="f2">Digital Media 2 </a>
						and 
						<a href="http://redwood.colorado.edu/didr8696/sound/" class="f2">Digital Sound</a>! But as an added bonus, I'd like to show you my 
						<a href="http://redwood.colorado.edu/didr8696/dm1/" class="f2">Digital Media 1 Portal </a>as well! All of these websites were made by myself for my classes in the Technology, Arts & Media program here at CU. Enjoy!

					<p> I've finally started to consolidate my photographs, many of which I took this Winter Break when I was home in Bozeman, Montana. I've got a couple of them uploaded to the <a href="photography.html" class="f3">Photography Page</a>. I'll be adding some descriptions to each photo soon. Check back soon! </p>

						My name is Dillon Drenzek. I am currently a 4th-year (out of 5) student at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I recently discovered my interest in "Digital Creativity" as I like to call it. I love creating art in the digital domain. This includes static visual art using <span class="f2">Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator</span>, motion picture art using <span class="f4">Autodesk Maya, Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects</span>, as well as audio art using programs like <span class="f5">Ableton Live, Propellerhead's Reason, and the open-source Audacity</span>. I consider myself a Jack of all trades, but whatever the flavor of the week happens to be, I try to completely commit myself to making the best end-product possible. Everything you see before you is all original and while I have a working knowledge in all the programs listed above, I definitely haven't learned all I'd like to. This will be a lifelong process. </p>
