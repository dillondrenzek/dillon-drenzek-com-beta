            <h3>Why Bicycles Get Right-of-Way on Campus</h3>

            <p>Imagine, if you will, a situation where a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian seems imminent. Who has more power to avoid contact, the pedestrian or the bicyclist? Instead of listening to your answer, I'm going to ask you another question, in this same situation, who is wearing the safety helmet and who has further to fall? Certainly not the pedestrian! Both parties understand the risks the bicyclist is assuming by choosing to cycle through crowds of students class instead of locking his bicycle to one of the many bicycle racks around campus and walking. So, wouldn't it be courteous of the pedestrian to yield to the bicyclist struggling to make it to class on time? It may not seem like such a big deal to some, but it is incredibly hard bicycling through campus during school hours! And without the bell on my handlebars, it would be downright impossible! The pedestrian to biker ratio is just too damn high! In fact, with so many pedestrians, the chances of <strong>not</strong> hitting or at least awkwardly crossing paths with someone are incredibly low.</p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p>Of course, by now you may be asking, “Well, why don't you just get off your bike and walk it to class?” But then what would be the point of riding your bike in the first place? That would defeat the purpose of having a bike. Besides, you would end up walking into class a couple of minutes later! It would be just as fast to walk!</p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p>I don't know, I guess this is just what I believe. Maybe I'm just more dedicated to getting to class on time than others. To each his own.</p>
